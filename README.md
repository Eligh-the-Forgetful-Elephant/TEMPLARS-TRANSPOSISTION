The plan is to use this as part of multiple stages in ctf challenges. more info to come.

use the source code of tranposition.py and run the program,
        
Basic usage :  # python transposition.py  
                  ENTER MESSAGE : Hello World
                #python transposition.py --decrypt
                  ENTER MESSAGE : Encrypted text here
